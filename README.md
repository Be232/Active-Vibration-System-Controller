# Intelligent-Control-Project
Adaptive control methods are used to control a mass-spring-damper (MSD) system with unknown or varying parameters. Three controllers are designed using the Backstepping approach: adaptive, linearly parameterized, and ANN-based. The ANN improves performance by learning system uncertainties in real time.
